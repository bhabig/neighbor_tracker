# New Neighbor Database

This new neighbor database is a Sinatra app that will allow you to keep track of who your neighbors are. This will come in handy especially when moving to a new neighborhood as the developer had when writing this app.

## Usage

Visit the app [here][1]. Sign Up. Add a house. Then add parents to that house. Then add some children. You should add a household in this order as parents are required to belong to a house and children are required to have parents.
